## **AI Interviewer Platform**

Your task is to build a lightweight web application where users can select a job and complete an **AI-driven interview**. The interview starts **voice-only**: the candidate talks to the screen, and the AI asks **dynamic questions that change based on what the user says**. 

---

## **Technical Specifications**

**Requirements:**

* Users can view a list of **sample jobs** (at least 3), each with a title \+ short description.

* When a user clicks a job, they enter an **Interview Room** for that role.

* Users can **talk via microphone** (voice input) and see the AI interviewer’s questions.

* The AI interviewer must ask **at least 6 questions**, including **at least 2 follow-ups that depend on the user’s prior answer**.

* The interview must be **role-grounded** (questions reflect the selected job).

* The app must **save the session** and display, at the end:

  * full transcript (Q/A turns)

  * a simple structured evaluation (JSON is fine: strengths, concerns, overall score)

* Clean, functional UI with minimal friction.

* Must work end-to-end in a hosted environment.

* All project code must be housed in a single public GitHub repository. The code must be deployed on a publicly viewable website (share password if using one). You may use any coding assistant tool and any resource online. This is an individual exercise.

## **Stretch goals (implement in order)**

1. **Deterministic interviewer state:** Show a “decision panel” that displays the interviewer’s current rubric/signals (skills detected, topics covered, gaps) and why it chose the next question.

2. **Job-specific question packs:** Add structured question banks per role (behavioral \+ technical categories), and have the AI select from them \+ generate targeted follow-ups.

3. **Video mode:** Add optional camera input and have the interview run in a “video call” layout (still voice-driven; video is just the interface/UX layer).

4. **Replay \+ analytics:** Add a session history page where users can replay interviews, filter by role, and see per-session metrics (duration, talk ratio, topic coverage, score trend).
